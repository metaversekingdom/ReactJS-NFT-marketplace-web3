## üí™ Motivation

<p>
I aim to create an open and safe NFT marketplace that is accessible to everyone. This will be a challenging task for both myself and the contributors involved, but through our collective efforts, we can develop an open-source, reliable, and visually appealing NFT marketplace that serves as a model for others to emulate. While our goal is not to operate an NFT marketplace ourselves, we hope to provide a template that can be easily forked and customized by others, ultimately benefiting artists and creators in the process. By pooling our skills and resources from diverse backgrounds, we can succeed in building a better world.
